# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
In this project, I tried to simulate the lifts traffic in a hotel. Often in the real world, we are asking about how long we must wait for a lift in order to get to our designated floor, how much travel time needed, and how the lift handle traffic queue in a busy time. In a hotel, the lift is an important feature for attendance or even hotel staffs. The usage of the hotel's lifts depends on how many guests are there in the hotel and how often they move between floors. 

To simulate the real world Hotel Lift, I make a program that can simulate a real-life situation. I build the code using an Object-Oriented method in which we can configure the environment of the hotel by using dictionary parameters. For example, we can configure how many floors that a hotel has, how many lifts, which floor that a lift serves, how many rooms for each floor, what are the room type and its capacity, how many people can a lift handle, etc. By using this complexity, I expect this code to be able to accommodate different scenarios.

For the simulation purpose, I tried to handle 3 different scenarios. Firstly, evacuation scenario, given the configuration in the particular hotel, we want to measure how long we can evacuate all the guest in the hotel room using lifts in the hotel. This scenario is useful to understand the effectiveness of the hotel lift configuration to handle evacuation and further can be used to develop a better queue or system for evacuation handling. Next, conference bulk check-in scenario, using the same configuration we will try to bring all the guest that comes at the random time to the designated floor. This scenario is useful to understand how long the attendance needs to spend the time to go to the designated floor in the busy situation. Finally, we can also try the real world lift usage by simulating people going in and out in a designated random time by configuring hotel occupancy and movement time.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
For the simulation purpose I used this following configuration:

Room Type:
- Single, Capacity: 2
- Double, Capacity: 2
- Deluxe, Capacity: 4

Hotel Floors: 20

Rooms every Floors:
- Single: 20
- Double: 20
- Deluxe: 10

Number of Lifts: 6
Configuration:
- 1: floor 0 - 19, speed 1 each floor
- 2: floor 0 - 19, speed 1 each floor
- 3: floor 0 - 9, speed 1 each floor
- 4: floor 0 - 9, speed 1 each floor
- 5: floor 10 - 19, speed 10 for 0 - 10, next speed 1 each floor
- 6: floor 10 - 19, speed 10 for 0 - 10, next speed 1 each floor

The time measure in this simulation is second, so we compute every single second for each object (Lift, and Guests) to measure they spending time.

Before running the simulation, I might use my hypothesis for every scenario:
- evacuation scenario: there is no relation within hotel occupancy and average waiting time and average in lift time in the evacuation scneario
- bulk check-in scenario: there is no relation within hotel occupancy and average waiting time and average in lift time in the evacuation scneario
- normal schedule scenario: there is no relation within hotel occupancy and average waiting time and average in lift time in the normal schedule scenario.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
There are several variables I used for the uncertainty:
- movement_waiting_time: is a movement parameter to produce a random variable of a person movement. Generating this random number will trigger the movement of a person after the designated time is reached. The waiting time itself is highly configurable and distributed in a Gaussian manner which skewed 2/3 to the left of the maximum time to simulate real-life behavior. The maximum waiting movement time can be configured in the json configuration file according to which schedule or what scenario we want to use
- door_closing_time: every time a lift door open in a floor, it has generated random waiting time to wait for another guest to get into the lift. This random waiting time is useful to simulate people behavior in a lift. People often push the close door button to close the lift immediately or just leave it closed automatically (maximum time). This variable is generated using normal Gaussian distribution with half of the maximum time as the mean. For this parameter, I used 10 seconds for the maximum door closing time
- assigned_schedule: attendances will be randomly assigned to a room and specific schedule according to the configuration file. To understand about the configuration more, look at the instructions on how to use the program

## Instructions on how to use the program:
To use the program, firstly we need to create a configuration file that contains parameter for the simulation, the sample scenario for normal schedule is given below
```
{
  "number_of_floor": 20,
  "lift_floor_configuration": {
    "0": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      "speed": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
    "1": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      "speed": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
    "2": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
      "speed": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
    "3": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
      "speed": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
    "4": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      "speed": [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
    "5": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      "speed": [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    }
  },
  "room_types_capacity": {"single": 2, "double": 2, "deluxe": 4},
  "rooms_floor_count": {"single": 20, "double": 20, "deluxe": 10},
  "scenario": [[[["room", 500], ["outside", 700], ["dining", 900], ["room", 0]], 0.5],
    [[["outside", 900], ["dining", 400], ["room", 0]], 0.3],
    [[["room", 400], ["dining", 900], ["conference", 300], ["room", 0]], 0.2]],
  "simulation_list": [[10, 0.1], [20, 0.2], [30, 0.3], [40, 0.4], [50, 0.5], [60, 0.6], [70, 0.7], [80, 0.8], [90, 0.9], [100, 1]],
  "attendance_log_name": "normal_attendance_{}.log",
  "lift_log_name": "normal_all_lift_{}.log",
  "thread_idle": 0.01,
  "iteration": 1}
```
with description as follow:
- number_of_floor: how many floors that we want to simulate
- lift_floor_configuration: is a dictionary containing configuration for a particular lift. For example:
```
"4": {
      "floor": [0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
      "speed": [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    },
```
This will create a lift named "4" which serve the 0,1,2,10-19 floors and speed, 1 second for 0 to 1 and 1 to 2, and 7 seconds for 2-10 floor
- room_types_capacity: definition of room and their capacity (max attendance per room), for example:
```
  "room_types_capacity": {"single": 2, "double": 2, "deluxe": 4},
```
  means that single has 2 max attendance, double: 2 max attendance and deluxe 4 maximum attendance. However, the number of attendance each room will be randomly determined using gaussian distribution skewed right.
- rooms_floor_count: description of how many rooms for each floor, these rooms will be assigned for each floor according to number of floor configuration. For example:
```
"rooms_floor_count": {"single": 20, "double": 20, "deluxe": 10},
```
means that a floor will have 20 single room, 20 double room and 10 deluxe room
- scenario: scenario of people moving in the hotel and using the elevators. The scenario will contain the list of position with existing position and target position in the next element, and the waiting time which will be distributed using gaussian distribution. Furthermore, the percentage of people using this schedule will be determine in the second element of a schedule list. For example:
```
  "scenario": [[[["room", 500], ["outside", 700], ["dining", 900], ["room", 0]], 0.5],
    [[["outside", 900], ["dining", 400], ["room", 0]], 0.3],
    [[["room", 400], ["dining", 900], ["conference", 300], ["room", 0]], 0.2]],
```
this scheduler contains three scheduled scenarios, first people moving from the room to outside (500s waiting time) , outside to dining (700s waiting time), dining to the room (900s waiting time). This schedule will be used by 50% population of the attendance (randomly). and followed by the second schedule 30% population, and third schedule 20% population
-  simulation_list: contains a list of list which descibed as the name in the first element and the percentage of occupancy in the second element. For example:
```
  "simulation_list": [[10, 0.1], [20, 0.2], [30, 0.3], [40, 0.4], [50, 0.5], [60, 0.6], [70, 0.7], [80, 0.8], [90, 0.9], [100, 1]],
```
means that for the simulation we will run 10 occupancy scenarios from 10% to 100%
- attendance_log_name: the log name for the attendance log, use the curly bracket for the template name from the simulation list. For example:
```
"attendance_log_name": "normal_attendance_{}.log",
```
- lift_log_name: the log name for the lift log, use the curly bracket for the template name from the simulation list. For example:
```
"lift_log_name": "normal_all_lift_{}.log",
```
- thread_idle: the interval for the second granularity in the simulation. For example
```
"thread_idle": 0.01,
```
means that each second will be simulated for every 0.01s real time speed

After we define the scenario file we can run the program by using
```
python hotel_lift_monte_carlo.py -c <configuration_file>
```
The program will read the configuration file and produce the attendance log file with like this example below

```
AttendanceName,StartMovingTime,FromFloor,ToFloor,WaitingTime,InLiftTime,TotalSpendTime
485,1,24,1,0,4,19,23
1390,5,24,1,0,1,18,19
667,17,31,0,2,7,7,14
234,9,31,0,2,15,7,22
760,18,31,0,2,7,6,13
596,9,31,0,2,17,5,22
643,2,31,0,2,22,7,29
582,8,31,0,2,17,6,23
1019,8,34,2,0,10,16,26
122,1,34,5,0,8,25,33
```
